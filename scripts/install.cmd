:: ============================================
:: Stormworks Head Tracking - Install
:: ============================================
:: Thin wrapper - install body lives in cameraunlock-core/scripts/install-body-shim-forwarder.cmd,
:: staged into the release ZIP's shared/ by Copy-SharedBundle. To change
:: install behaviour edit the body, not this wrapper.
::
:: Source of truth for everything below the CONFIG BLOCK:
:: cameraunlock-core/scripts/templates/install-wrapper-shim-forwarder.cmd. Copy
:: this file to <mod>/scripts/install.cmd, fill in the CONFIG BLOCK, change
:: nothing else. scripts/conformance.ps1 checks that nothing else changed.
::
:: Forwarding shim: the mod DLL is a system-DLL proxy whose exports forward to
:: a renamed copy of the real system DLL, which cannot ship in the ZIP. The
:: body copies it from the user's own system directory next to the shim. Any
:: pre-existing DLL at the shim's name is preserved as <name>.backup for
:: uninstall to restore, and there is no framework, so FRAMEWORK_TYPE is None.
:: The matching uninstall.cmd lists SYSTEM_DLL_COPY in its MOD_DLLS.

:: too, but that is one `call` too late to save the argument it was handed.
